# MCP Relation Properties Bug Fix

## Problem
When using the Notion MCP server, relation properties between databases are not correctly resolved, causing broken links or missing data in Claude Desktop integrations.

## Solution
This fix patches the MCP server's relation property handler to ensure related database entries are fetched and linked properly.

## How it Works
- Intercepts relation property requests
- Fetches related database entries using the Notion API
- Returns complete relation data to Claude Desktop

## Usage
1. Copy `fix.js` into your MCP server's custom middleware directory or import as needed.
2. Run `test.js` to verify the fix.
3. See `examples/before.json` and `examples/after.json` for expected results.

## Files
- `fix.js` – The patch code
- `test.js` – Test cases
- `install.sh` – Installation script
- `examples/` – Before/after data
